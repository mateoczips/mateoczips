<b>Hi, I'm Mateusz</b>

Big fan of Tolkien, Martin and any invented world. I love board and video games, and divide my free time between exploring new technologies and replenishing the internal library of knowledge in my head.

I'm currently learning the basics of web application development and very much hope to become a full-fledged developer in the near future.
