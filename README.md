<b>Hi, I'm Mateusz</b>

Big fan of Tolkien, Martin and any invented world. I love board and video games, and divide my free time between exploring new technologies and replenishing the internal library of knowledge in my head.

I'm currently working as a web application developer and very much hope to become better and better at it!
